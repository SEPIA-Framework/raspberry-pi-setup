# SEPIA Client Installation - Raspberry Pi

## Common Instructions

### 1) Install Raspbian Buster Lite

* Download Raspbian Buster
* Flash MicroSD with Etcher
* Remove MicroSD and replug (to reload filesystem)
* Add an empty file called 'ssh' to the boot folder ([microSD]/boot) to enable SSH
* Add a file called 'wpa_supplicant.conf' with the following content to the boot folder to enable WiFi login (replace 'country' [US, DE, ..], 'ssid' and 'psk'):
```
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
    ssid="NETWORK-NAME"
    psk="NETWORK-PASSWORD"
}
```
* Eject the MicroSD and plug it into your RPi
* Connect to your RPi via SSH (in Windows you can use [putty](https://www.putty.org/))
* Finish your RPi setup with `sudo raspi-config` (expand SD card, set timezone, etc.)

### 2) Run SEPIA Client Installation

* Connect your hardware to the RPi (USB mic, ReSpeaker HAT, Hyperpixel Touchscreen, etc.)
* Choose one of the variants below to install your client.

### 3) Run SEPIA Client Setup

* Run `bash setup.sh` from the `~/sepia-client` folder
* Set SEPIA server host address (as you would inside your SEPIA app login box)
* Optional: Define a unique device ID (default is 'o1', Android apps have 'a1' and browsers 'b1' by default)
* Optional: Define a new CLEXI-ID (this can be used as password for the remote terminal later, default is: clexi-123)
* Finish your setup by setting automatic login via `sudo raspi-config` (Boot options - Desktop/CLI - Console Autologin)
* Reboot your system 
* Your headless client should automatically start and notify you via a short audio message that he'll be "right there"

### 4) Configure the Client via Remote Connection

* Continue the setup in your [SEPIA Control HUB](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-admin-tools/tree/master/admin-web-tools) by opening the 'client connections' page. Make sure to use the HTTP address (not HTTPS) to avoid mixed-content errors due to the 'ws://' URL below!
* The CLEXI server of your newly installed SEPIA Client should be reachable at `ws://[rpi-IP]:9090/clexi` (via Nginx proxy)
* Enter your CLEXI-ID from the previous step (or use the default) and press the 'CONNECT' button. The remote terminal window at the bottom will show the status of the connection.
* By default your headless client will start the 'setup mode'. This might take a while, depending on your RPi model. You should hear the audio message "ready for setup" at some point
* Use the remote terminal to ping all connected clients by typing `ping all` or use the shortcut button right above the terminal input field
* Your SEPIA Client should answer with client info, device ID and a short message. If this is not the case something went wrong during the setup. Try to reboot your RPi and observe your CLEXI connection status.
* Copy the device ID into the field with the same name (right above the shortcut buttons)
* Use the remote terminal command `call login user [user-ID] password [user-pwd]` (message type: 'SEPIA Client') to login your user
* You should see a "login successful" message in the terminal. If not you can use the command `call ping` to see if the client can reach the SEPIA server. Check your "hostname" settings from the previous step (Client Setup) if ping fails
* Use the command `call test` (message type: 'SEPIA Client') or corresponding shortcut button 'test client' to ... test your client. You should hear an acoustic confirmation
* Reboot your system one last time to finish the configuration (NOTE: your microphone will only have access permission AFTER the reboot)

### 5) Fine Tuning

* Optional: Open the CLEXI settings.json file located at `~/clexi/www/sepia/settings.js` to tweak your client (e.g. activate "Hey SEPIA"). NOTE: please do this AFTER a successful configuration and reboot (previous step)
* Done. Enjoy! :-)

## Variants

Choose one of the following variants that fits best to your hardware.

## Variant 1: USB Mic - Speakers via audio jack

Tested with: Raspian Buster, RPi3, RPi4

### Install

* Create installation folder `mkdir -p ~/install` and switch to directory `cd ~/install`
* Download one of the install scripts:
  * Current release version: `wget https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-installation-and-setup/raw/master/sepia-client-installation/sepia_client_rpi_raspbian_buster.zip`
  * Most recent developer version: `wget https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-installation-and-setup/raw/dev/sepia-client-installation/sepia_client_rpi_raspbian_buster.zip`
* `unzip sepia_client_rpi_raspbian_buster.zip`
* Run the install script with one of these options:
  * Default: `bash install_sepia_client.sh`
  * Skip Bluetooth components: `bash install_sepia_client.sh skipBLE`
  * Use dev branch client: `bash install_sepia_client.sh dev`
* `bash install_usb_mic.sh`
* Reboot the system
* Continue with the step 'SEPIA Client Setup' of the common instruction above

## Variant 2: ReSpeaker 2 Mic HAT - Speakers via ReSpeaker audio jack

Tested with: Raspian Buster, RPi3, RPi Zero

### Install

* Download scripts as described in variant 1 (wget ...)
* Run the ReSpeaker installation first: `bash install_respeaker_mic.sh`
* Continue with variant 1 installation procedure
* DON'T use 'install_usb_mic.sh' at the end ;-)
* Run `bash update_respeaker_boot.sh` to deactivate unused RPi default audio jack
* Reboot the system
* Continue with the step 'SEPIA Client Setup' of the common instruction above

## Variant 3: Hyperpixel 4.0 Touchscreen - USB Mic - Speakers via audio jack

Tested with: Raspian Buster, RPi4

### Install

* Install the Hyperpixel touchscreen first: `curl https://get.pimoroni.com/hyperpixel4 | bash`
* Continue with variant 1 installation procedure
* Use `bash setup.sh` to switch between 'display', 'headless' or 'pseudo-headless' mode
* If you have problems with the touchscreen (swapped axis etc.) run `bash update_hyperpixel4_boot.sh`
* If your screen width is smaller than 500px, e.g. 480px (typical Hyperpixel width) you can use `bash adapt_to_small_screen.sh 20` to shift the screen by 20px (chromium bug)
* Continue with the step 'SEPIA Client Setup' of the common instruction above or configure system via display/touchscreen

## Basic uninstallation steps

There is no uninstall script yet and some things will depend on your specific installation variant. The easiest way is to simply reinstall the OS but here are roughly the required steps:
* Open the folder `~/sepia-client` and run `shutdown.sh`
* Delete folder `~/sepia-client`
* Delete folder `~/clexi`
* Delete folder `~/.config/openbox` and remove 'openbox' via `sudo apt-get remove openbox`
* Remove Chromium via `sudo apt-get remove chromium-browser`
* Open `~/.bashrc` and remove the SEPIA entry below '# Run SEPIA-Client on login?'
* Delete, check or adjust your ALSA config `~/.asoundrc` pr√ºfen oder entfernen

Whats left are packages like Node.js, Xserver and hardware related stuff (if you've installed a touchscreen or microphone etc.).
